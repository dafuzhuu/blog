## TPO 75 The Palaces of Minoan Crete

> From the early twentieth-century work of archaeologist Arthur Evans onwards, the ingrained and embedded religious nature of the palaces has been accepted, as has the fact that "palace" is inadequate shorthand for the buildings' complexities.

这里提到从20世纪初考古学家Arthur Evans的工作开始，人们已经接受了这些宫殿内在的宗教性质，并且认识到“palace”这个词不足以概括这些建筑的复杂性。

"has been accepted" 没有出现accept的主体，"as has the fact that" 故技重施，也是被accept的对象

> Accurate terminology that did not privilege one function over another would require the coinage of a portmanteau term such as "palace-temple” or "temple-palace,” but this seems an undesirable deviation from terminology that is long established, whatever its shortcomings.

如果要精确描述而不偏向任何一种功能，就需要创造出类似于“palace-temple”或“temple-palace”这样的混合词汇，但这似乎是对长期以来已确立术语的不必要偏离。

"did not privilege one function over another" 是个很漂亮的写法，

**privilege A over B**，等价于prefer A to B，consider A more important than B

## TPO 71 Minoan Palaces

### 结构

1. Minoan palace的功能
2. 第一个功能：production & storage of food -> Phaistos(Unit A, B)
3. Mallia(stone, smith, fume, close control)
4. 第二个功能：depositories & regulator -> storage bins?
5. 第三个功能：foreign trade -> Kamares

### 小结题分析

> F.The discovery in Cyprus and the Near East of goods made in Minoan Crete indicates that an extensive trade network developed between Crete and these areas during the Palace Period.

这个选项为什么错？

先不管是不是 extensive，主体没有谈及 palace，就是离题，可以果断排除

## TPO 70 The Development of Chinese Dynasties

> It is generally understood that the river running through a vast area where the fine and porous soil accounts for the large silt content in its current has a constant tendency to clog its own course and cause dikes to break and enormous inundations to occur.

这里 fine and porous 是细密、多孔的意思，导致水流中的淤泥含量较高，这种河流往往会不断淤积，堵塞河道，从而导致堤坝决口和大规模的洪涝灾害
