<ul>
<li>Are there educational, personal, cultural, economic, or social experiences, not described in your Statement of Purpose, that have shaped your academic journey? If so, how? Have any of these experiences provided unique perspective(s) that you would contribute to your program, field or profession?</li>
<li>Describe challenge(s) or barriers that you have faced in your pursuit of higher education. What motivated you to persist, and how did you overcome them? What is the evidence of your persistence, progress or success?</li>
<li>How have your life experiences and educational background informed your understanding of the barriers facing groups that are underrepresented in higher education?</li>
<li>How have you been actively engaged (e.g., through participation, employment, service, teaching or other activities) in programs or activities focused on increasing participation by groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education?</li>
<li>How do you intend to engage in scholarly discourse, research, teaching, creative efforts, and/or community engagement during your graduate program that have the potential to advance diversity and equal opportunity in higher education?</li>
<li>How do you see yourself contributing to diversity in your profession after you earn your advanced degree at UCLA?</li>
